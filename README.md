**Scenario 1: AI Innovation in Semi-Trucks**

Let’s consider a new ambitious vision that has become a strategic priority:

**Objective:** Develop a **cutting-edge AI feature for semi-trucks** to enhance the capabilities of Heavy Auto Manufacturer, setting the company apart from competitors.

**Industry:** Heavy Auto Manufacturer

**Stakeholders Involved:** SME's, CEO, VP, PM, Technical Teams

If it is a success, Heavy Auto Manufacturer, Inc. has a chance to lead the market for AI and truck Industries. What are the risks, rewards and challenges involved in this scinario ?. 


**Task Analysis Response:**

**1. Risks Involved:**

•	Market Adoption Risks (high upfront costs for a new truck, lack of trust in the automation, Regulatory Challenges, Driver Pushback like job security fear due to Automation)

•	Technology feasibility challenges (as due to extreme weather conditions, load weight, traffic and AI in truck business might be complex) , AI Privacy Laws

•	High Competition (from a big players), Ethical Considerations

•	Driver Safety Concerns, High R&D Costs, Financial and execution risks. 



**2. Rewards:**

•	First Mover Advantage, If successful Stay Ahead of Competition

•	Increased Revenue Growth (High ROI)

•	Improved Safety, Customer Satisfaction

•	Next Generation Transportation



**3. Challenges: (Obstacles to Overcome)**

•	Massive Real time datasets, AI Models, Model Training, AI Reliability in Real World Applications. 

•	Compliances, Regional Frameworks

•	Local and International Competitions



**4. Collaborate:**

•	Internal: Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Product Management, Leadership, Brand Strategy, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Hardware and Finance.

•	External: Chip Manufacturers, Cloud Providers, Logistic, Insurance Provider, Government, Channel Partners and Transport Agencies

•	Others: Investors, Board of Directors, Research Grands, Venture Capitals and External colloborations



**5. Scope of work:**

•	Phase 1: Idea Phase (Design and Discovery Phase) - Data Collection Phase, Identifying Customers Pain Points (i.e. Truck Drivers), Market Analysis, Competitor Analysis.

•	Phase 2: AI System Design And review Phase 

•	Phase 3: Testing and Reviews Phase

•	Phase 4: Product Launch, New Product Introduction, Industry Distruption, 

•	Phase 4: Product Maintenance (Trucks), 

•	Phase 5: End of Life (EOL)


Can We Call It a Blue Ocean Strategy?

Yes, If the AI feature redefines trucking operations and safety in a way that competitors have not considered → It’s a Blue Ocean Strategy.

Nope., If it’s just a better version of what already exists (e.g., slightly smarter autopilot, better fuel efficiency monitoring) → It’s still a Red Ocean move.
